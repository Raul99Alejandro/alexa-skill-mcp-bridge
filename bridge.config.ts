/**
 * THE config file: the settings of the bridge itself, and it is meant to stay committable
 * exactly as it ships. Every consumer validates it with zod at load time; invalid values
 * fail early with the field path and the fix.
 *
 * What is yours rather than the project's goes in a git-ignored `.env` instead (copy
 * `.env.example`), which overrides the fields below: your MCP URL, your secret name, your
 * skill id, your region. Secrets themselves never live in either file: put a Secrets Manager
 * secret name in `mcp.auth.secretName` and the runtime fetches the value at startup.
 *
 * After changing anything under `mcp.*`, `skill.invocationName`, or `skill.locales`,
 * run `npm run generate`. After changing anything else that reaches AWS, run `npm run deploy`.
